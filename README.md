## Class:

### 1.Fitness: 
Define a simple Fitness function: fitnessScore = (endlength-beginlength)/generations

### 2.GenoType: 
Define chromosomes and genotypes, and how genotypes are expressed

### 3.JeneticsAlgorithm(run this):
Use Jenetics to perform gene mutation, selection, Crossover, and get the best phenotype (pattern).

### 4.Population: 
A population is a collection of genotypes, and multiple genotypes can be randomly generated and stored.

### 5.RunSimpleGameHere(run this):
Multiple genotypes are generated from the population class and inherited under natural conditions through their phenotypes. Finally, FitnessScore is calculated. The output includes three parts: each genotype and its phenotype, the genetic process with the highest FitnessScore genotype, and the individual genotypes are ranked according to the FitnessScore score.
